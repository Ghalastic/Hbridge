# Move a DC Motor with H-Bridge
## Task Description:- 
Run H-bridge with a DC motor using Arduino on Tinkercad
#### 
### Program:
Tinkercad
#### 
### Duration:
30 Minutes
#### 
## Part 1 - Move the DC Motor Clockwise and Counterclockwise 
#### 
## A Step-By-Step Guide:-
1- Open [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and click on create, then click on circuits.
#### 
### 2- Gather the components, which are:
#### 
- Arduino Uno R3
- L293D H-Bridge Motor Driver (place it on the breadboard)
- 2 Pushbuttons (place both of them on the breadboard next to the H-Bridge)
- DC Motor
- Breadboard
#### 
### 3- Make the Necessary Connections:-
#### 
#### - Arduino Connections:
1- Connect it to the Breadboard
2- Connect it to the L293D H-Bridge Motor Driver
#### 
#### - H-Bridge Connections:
1- Connect it to the DC Motor
2- Connect it to the Breadboard
####
#### For a clear understanding of the wiring and connections, follow this circuit diagram:
